# Kernel Methods For Machine Learning - 2021 - DataChallenge

Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind specific sequence motifs in the genome to activate or repress transcription of target genes. This data challenge consisted in predicting whether a DNA sequences is a binding site for a given TF or not. The classification into bound (label 1) or unbound (label 0) was done on 3 different datasets each composed of 2000 DNA sequences of length 101 nucleotides belonging to {A,C,G,T\}. This challenge brought us to explore kernel methods for classification and therefore implement several kernels and typical classifiers detailed in the following sections.
